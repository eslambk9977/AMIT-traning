Error bars are graphical representations of the variability of data and used on graphs to indicate the error or uncertainty in a reported measurement.
Three different types of values are commonly used for error bars, sometimes without even specifying which one is used. It is important to understand how they are calculated, since they give very different results (see above). Letâ€™s compute them on a simple vector:
Standard Deviation:
Standard Error :
Confidence Interval:
Error bars give a general idea of how precise a measurement is, or conversely, how far from the reported value the true (error free) value might be. If the value displayed on your barplot is the result of an aggregation (like the mean value of several data points), you may want to display error bars.
